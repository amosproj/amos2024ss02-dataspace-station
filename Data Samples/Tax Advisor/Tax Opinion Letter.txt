Tax Opinion Letter

To: Board of Directors, ABC Corporation
From: Jane Doe, CPA, Tax Advisor, XYZ Tax Advisory Services
Date: December 31, 2023
Subject: Tax Treatment of Research and Development (R&D) Expenditures

Introduction

This opinion letter addresses the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditures incurred by ABC Corporation during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Based on our review of the relevant tax laws, regulations, and case law, we provide our professional opinion on whether these expenditures can be immediately deducted or must be capitalized and amortized.

Facts

ABC Corporation incurred $500,000 in R&D expenditures in the 2023 fiscal year. These expenditures include salaries for R&D personnel, costs of materials and supplies used in R&D activities, and payments to third-party contractors for R&D services. ABC Corporation is considering whether these expenditures should be immediately deducted under Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) or capitalized and amortized over a specified period.

Issue

The primary issue is whether the R&D expenditures incurred by ABC Corporation qualify for immediate deduction under IRC Section 174 or if they must be capitalized and amortized over a period of five or ten years, as prescribed by recent tax law changes.

Analysis

1. Internal Revenue Code Section 174

IRC Section 174 allows taxpayers to treat R&D expenditures as expenses that are not chargeable to the capital account and to deduct such expenditures in the taxable year in which they are paid or incurred. Alternatively, taxpayers may elect to capitalize and amortize these expenditures over a period of not less than 60 months, beginning with the month in which they are paid or incurred.

2. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017

The TCJA introduced significant changes to the treatment of R&D expenditures. For amounts paid or incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, taxpayers are required to capitalize and amortize specified R&D expenditures over a period of five years (15 years for foreign research). This change eliminates the option for immediate deduction under IRC Section 174.

3. Application to ABC Corporation

Given that ABC Corporation incurred the R&D expenditures in the 2023 fiscal year, the new capitalization and amortization requirements introduced by the TCJA apply. Therefore, ABC Corporation must capitalize and amortize the R&D expenditures over a five-year period.

4. Exceptions and Special Rules

There are specific exceptions and special rules that may apply to certain types of R&D expenditures, such as software development costs or expenditures funded by government grants. However, based on the information provided, no such exceptions appear to be applicable to ABC Corporation's R&D expenditures.

Conclusion

Based on our analysis of IRC Section 174 and the changes introduced by the TCJA, it is our professional opinion that ABC Corporation must capitalize and amortize the $500,000 in R&D expenditures incurred during the 2023 fiscal year over a five-year period. Immediate deduction of these expenditures is not permitted under current tax law.

Recommendation

We recommend that ABC Corporation update its accounting and tax reporting procedures to reflect the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenditures in compliance with the TCJA. Additionally, ABC Corporation should consider consulting with its internal accounting team and legal advisors to ensure full compliance with all applicable tax laws and regulations.
