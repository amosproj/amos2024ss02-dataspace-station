## üìñ About

With the increase of data exchange among different sectors like finance, legal, healthcare, government and others, ensuring easy interoperability while still following data usage rules, policies, and local regulations is becoming increasingly important. **Dataspace** is the envisioned solution to tackle these challenges.

Dataspace operates with the help of **data connectors**, which enable secure and effective communication and exchange of data. They are a tool to connect many data endpoints to increase the pool of available data and to accelerate the data economy. By linking data connectors, dataspaces become protected environments where participants can freely share data. Data sovereignty, transparency and fairness are ensured by adherence to a set of rules.

Our goal is to explore the feasibiltiy of dataspace usage with regards to data sovereignty. This includes testing the maturity of dataspace, importance of the components and ease of deployment.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

To run the connectors on your own machine, installing Docker is enough. If you don't want to use Docker, make sure that you have the following packages installed:

| Package  | Version |
| -------- | ------- |
| JDK  | 17  |
| Gradle  | 8.7 |
| jq  | 1.7.1 |
| npm  | 10.7 |
| node  | 22.2 | 
<br>

## üê≥ Docker usage

To run the code using docker, use the following commands in the `src` folder:

```
sudo docker compose build
sudo docker compose up
```
<br>

<span style="color:red"><b> Note: </b></span> If you are using macOS, you might have to modify the `config.json` file:
1. Go to `~/.docker/config.json`.
2. Change the `credsStore` value from `desktop` to `osxkeychain`.

Alternatively you may:
1. Go to `sudo vi  ~/.docker/config.json`.
2. Change `credsStore` to `credStore`.

<br>

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the connectors locally

To run the connectors without using Docker, you have to use four different terminals. Use the following commands in separate terminals:

### Company connector

In the first terminal, use the following command to build Gradle project and run the company connector:

```
./gradlew connector:build

java -Dedc.keystore=resources/certs/cert.pfx -Dedc.keystore.password=123456 -Dedc.vault=resources/configuration/company-vault.properties -Dedc.fs.config=resources/configuration/company-configuration.properties -jar connector/build/libs/connector.jar
```

### Tax advisor connector

In the second terminal, use the following command to run the tax advisor connector:

```
java -Dedc.keystore=resources/certs/cert.pfx -Dedc.keystore.password=123456 -Dedc.vault=resources/configuration/tax_advisor-vault.properties -Dedc.fs.config=resources/configuration/tax_advisor-configuration.properties -jar connector/build/libs/connector.jar
```

### Bank connector

In the third terminal, use the following command to run the bank connector:

```
java -Dedc.keystore=resources/certs/cert.pfx -Dedc.keystore.password=123456 -Dedc.vault=resources/configuration/bank-vault.properties -Dedc.fs.config=resources/configuration/bank-configuration.properties -jar connector/build/libs/connector.jar
```

### Running the web app

Run the app in the forth (main) terminal:

```
cd frontend_socket/international-dataspace-station
npm run dev
```

After this, you can access the app at `https://localhost:3000`.

<br>

## üîó Establishing connection for data exchange

Send the following HTTP requests to establish a connection between different connectors to be able to exchange data (replace `{{provider port}}`/`{{consumer port}}` with the corresponding ports on which the connector that provides/consumes data is running):

#### 1. Register data plane

```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d @resources/dataplane/register-data-plane-provider.json \
     -X POST "http://localhost:{{provider port}}/management/v2/dataplanes" -s | jq
```

#### 2. Create an asset

```
curl -d @resources/create-asset.json \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' http://localhost:{{provider port}}/management/v3/assets \
  -s | jq
```

#### 3. Create a policy

```
curl -d @resources/create-policy.json \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' http://localhost:{{provider port}}/management/v2/policydefinitions \
  -s | jq
```

#### 4. Create a contract definition

```
curl -d @resources/create-contract-definition.json \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' http://localhost:{{provider port}}/management/v2/contractdefinitions \
  -s | jq
```

#### 5. Fetch catalog

```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:{{consumer port}}/management/v2/catalog/request" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d @resources/fetch-catalog.json -s | jq
```

#### 6. Negotiate contract

Replace the `{{contract-offer-id}}` placeholder in `negotiate-contract.json` with the contract offer id you found in the catalog at the path `dcat:dataset.odrl:hasPolicy.@id`:

```
curl -d @resources/negotiate-contract.json \
  -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' http://localhost:{{consumer port}}/management/v2/contractnegotiations \
  -s | jq
```

#### 7. Get contract agreement id

Replace `{{id}}` with the contract negotiation id from the consumer terminal:

```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:29193/management/v2/transferprocesses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d @resources/start-transfer.json \
    -s | jq
```

<br>
The connectors have now been configured successfully and are ready to be used.

#### 8.  Start the transfer

Before executing the request, modify the `start-transfer.json` by inserting the contract agreement ID from the previous step. You can re-use the same asset, policies and contract negotiation from before.

```
curl -d @resources/negotiate-contract.json \
  -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' http://localhost:{{consumer port}}/management/v2/contractnegotiations \
  -s | jq
```
